# React Docs - Thinking in React

1. The idea that a piece of code should have one responsibility. Using components means a piece of code is responsible for generating that DOM component.
2. A static site is unchanging if there is some text it's hard coded.
3. Interactivity
4. Is it passed in form a parent via props? Does it remain unchanged over time? Can you compute it base on any other state or props in your component?
5. Finding the highest level item that renders something base on that state, or create a component that can be that highest level item.

# Higher-Order Functions

1. Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return other functions.
2. Return m when m is greater than n.
3. Map is often used as a higher-order function to perform an operation on each member of an array.
