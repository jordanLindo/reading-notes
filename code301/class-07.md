Interaction with servers allows us to use data effectively.

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. A researcher deeply involved in the first servers and the early web.
2. We interact with a common point, but without that interaction you can't tell a machine to interact.
3. Instructs a machine to get something.
4. Post allows one machine to add to the pool of information that other machines can get it from.
5. Put is used to replace something.
6. Patch is used update a part of something.
