2. The characteristics are: Reusability, Replaceable, Not context specific, Extensible, Encapsulated, and Independent - [Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)
3. The advantages are: Ease of deployment, Reduced cost, Ease of development, Reusable, modification of technical complexity, Reliability, System maintenance and evolution, Independent - [Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)
