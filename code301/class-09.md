Understanding the different options allows better choices to be made.

## Functional Programming Concepts

1. A programing paradigm that focuses on computation and avoids changing-state and mutable data - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
2. A pure function given the same input will always give the same output, and do not alter anything beyond the output.
3. Using pure functions can better hold you to the single responsibility principle. It also makes it easier to test.
4. Disallowing changes.
5. Using a pure function and returning to a new variable.

1. A module is a javaScript file that can be called from others to run the code within the module.exports
2. require() checks a file path and returns the function listed in exports.
3. Using require with a path gets the exported functions.
4. Set a variable to the return of require(file path) and call that variable like a call back function.
