# Reading Notes Class-14b

Understanding what can make a team work better together can make life at work easier and more enjoyable.

When I was working with scheduling team on the Capstone project our scrum meetings often got off track and we would talk about our lives, thinking back on it they were generally enjoyable chats, we were often able to identify and resolve minor issues that occurred. When we switched to remote tools, we did seem to lose that conversational atmosphere, and some group members did seem to struggle more to complete their tasks, perhaps the change in venue effected their willingness to share their problems.
