# Reading Notes 06

This is important in order to understand how JavaScript interacts with web pages.

## JavaScript

1. Grab any item ask them what it is. Ask what makes it that. Say this item is an object of item type. These objects have "the description given" in common.
2. useful for a one off object avoiding the overhead of the constructor.
3. an array is an object, objects can be used to effectively describe a version of an actual object for data modeling purposes.
4. . notation is limited to alphanumeric names for properties
5. the dog that is being created, this keyword connects the partial object to the function being used in its creation, avoiding a function that should be called in reflation to the new object needing to wait for its completion before being run.

## DOM

1. The document object model is the representation of the document.
2. The dom gives javascript something it understands and can alter.
