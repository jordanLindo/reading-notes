# Reading Notes Class-08

Even those not focusing on design should have a basic understanding of how to alter the layout of a page.

## CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox content orients into a row or a column.
2. Main axis is determined by the flex-direction and defaults to row.
3. A screen-reader following the dom would not follow the visual order.

## Layout - Flexbox

1. Flexbox vertically centers content, splits main axis total size evenly between each child element.
2. Understanding an effective layout makes creating attractive pages simpler.
