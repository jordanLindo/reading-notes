# Reading Notes 05

## HTML

1. I as a visually impaired person need to know what is in an image
2. an effective description of an image as the alt element a screen-reader can better handle imparting the image to a user
3. a "figure can be used to provide essential information supporting the main text" -- mdn web docs
4. svg scalable vector graphic essentially draws the image from a set of commands making it a good choice when the size of the image is unknown. GIF graphics interchange format is highly compatible, and useful for simple animations -- mdn web docs
5. jpeg for quality and compatibility

## CSS

1. background color is your paper, and foreground color is the marker color you intend to draw with
2. find a color palette created by someone better at choosing them, use the lightest for the main body of text and the darker options for emphatic use
3. compatibility, the possibility of different browsers rendering it differently, and readability, if a script is difficult to read it doesn't matter what it says
4. font-size effects the size, font-weight effects the thickness of the font, font-style is used to set the italic option
5. letter spacing, or find a font with increased spacing
